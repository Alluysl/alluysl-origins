# Alluysl's Origins

This is an attempt at a Fabric mod and my first attempt at any relevant mod for that matter. I'll see what I can do to make a mod that adds origins out of it. Let's see how it goes!

## Origins

### Clam (WIP)

It probably needs balancing so expect changes.

An aquatic origin meant to be more sedentary than the merling.

#### Hidden Pearl

Every 24 minutes, you can get an ender pearl for free!

#### Sand Burrow

You mine sand very fast. [Here is how it looks like in real life](https://youtu.be/S6FnmoB6ptA).

#### Shield Wielder

You get armor, even more when sneaking, since your shell protects you.

#### Usual water powers

You can breathe underwater, but not on land. You see and mine underwater as well as on land. However you don't get the sink prevention, extra swim speed, conduit power on land, or air from potions that merlings have.
