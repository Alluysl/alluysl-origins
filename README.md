# Alluysl's Origins

A mod that adds one origin for now, and should add more in the future.

## Origins

Don't hesitate to give feedback about powers or balancing!

### Clam

Designed in close collaboration with [DrCrowller](https://github.com/DrCrowller).

An aquatic origin meant to be more sedentary than the merling.

#### Hidden Pearl

Every 20 minutes, you can get an ender pearl for free!

#### Sand Burrow

You mine sand very fast. [Here is how it looks like in real life](https://youtu.be/S6FnmoB6ptA).

#### Shield Wielder

You get armor, even more when sneaking, since your shell protects you.

#### Usual water powers

You can breathe underwater, but not on land. You see and mine underwater as well as on land. However you don't get the sink prevention, extra swim speed, conduit power on land, or air from potions that merlings have.
